# Flappy Bird by GummyVEVO

This is a simple version of the popular game Flappy Bird made using Pygame. The objective of the game is to navigate the bird through a series of obstacles without hitting them. The game ends when the bird hits an obstacle or falls off the screen.

## Getting Started

To play the game, you need to install Pygame first. You can do that by running the following command:

```python
pip install pygame
```

Once you have Pygame installed, you can run the game by running the `main.py` file.

## How to Play

Click the mouse or press the space bar to flap the bird's wings and make it fly. The bird will fall if you don't flap its wings, so make sure to keep clicking or pressing the space bar to keep it in the air. Navigate the bird through the gaps in the obstacles to score points. The game ends when the bird hits an obstacle or falls off the screen.
